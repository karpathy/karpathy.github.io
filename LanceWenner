Hello Dr. Karpathy, 

I am a retired (72 year old) BSEE with many years of research that I would like to open access publish in ArXiv.

Have no current associatiation with anyone to sponser.  Paper mostly Macro Physics about time dilation.

Since not wishing to waste years of research results, could you sponser me so I can at least submit the paper.

I can send resume or whatever you need by giving me an active email address.  I do not wish to sell you anything. 

Do xhtml myself and have websites like nucow.com and would do some free work for you anytime.

Do not know PHP, javascript but do use them along with Adobe Dreamweaver CS5 and CSS.

nucow.com has almost 3,000 pages and many videos imbedded in it.  Site never sells (show high prices) but supports preservation of
antique radios etc. with zero google ad words delaying page loading.  Also my images are compressed.  Check out how fast a page loads
even without a great server. 

My email is lew@nucow.com

In your deep learning you (yes watched some of your youtube) indicated that it is hard to find humans to spend
time helping in your research.  Let me suggest using retired science people like me who no longer require a job.

Do let me know

Lance Wenner
